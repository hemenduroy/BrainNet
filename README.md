## Biometric Liveness Detector
A mobile application that acts as a verification server for liveness detection of brain signals. CSV formatted brain signal data will be sent to app over the Internet. The signal will then be analyzed using various Machine Learning models, the results of which will be voted upon. The algorithm with the highest confidence level will be reported with its results on the liveness of the signal along with relevant performance parameters.

By  liveness  detection,  we  mean  that  input  should have  two properties: 1) belong to a live human being (not artificially generated), and 2) being captured  at  the  current  point  in  time  (notbeing  prerecorded). The  project  will  be focused on ensuring the first property.
