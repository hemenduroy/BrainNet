## Biometric Liveness Detector
A mobile application that acts as a verification server for liveness detectionfor brain signals. Data will be sent to app on the phone through some communication channel (Internet or Bluetooth), the app will analyze it (machine learning techniques)and announce the result (live or not live).

By  liveness  detection,  we  mean  that  input  should have  two properties: 1)belong to a live human being (not artificially generated), and 2) being captured  at  the  current  point  in  time  (notbeing  prerecorded). The  project  will  be focused on ensuring the first properties of liveness. The project will be focused on the first feature of liveness (live input that is not artificially generated).
